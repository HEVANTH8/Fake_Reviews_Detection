# Fake_Reviews_Detection

Detection of fake reviews out of a massive collection of reviews from various distinct categories like Home and Office, Sports, etc.
Each review has a corresponding rating and a labels: CG (Computer-Generated Review) or OR (Original Review created by humans).

Our Main Task is to Detect whether the review is Computer-Generated (or) Original Reivew Generated by Human.

## Description
The generated fake reviews dataset contains 20,000 fake reviews and 20,000 real product reviews.  
- **OR** = Original reviews (presumably human-created and authentic)  
- **CG** = Computer-generated fake reviews
